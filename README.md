# hello, friend

### welcome to the land of simbyte.

i am simbyte. i have had a passion for programming and cybersecurity (or lack thereof it) for years, and only recently decided to full-throttle nosedive into the world of GitHub and the like to fully embrace the talent of coding.

while i am only an amateur programmer currently, i intend on using my projects as a way to get into the infosec community better, and learn as i go on!

### whoami

"simbyte" is a portmanteau of "sim", as in "simulation", and "byte", and made around the idea of a "simbyote". the name was initially made with the idea that my projects and their usabilities would latch onto you à la Venom, but in the digital space (hence "sim").

other than that, i am faceless, voiceless, nameless. the idea of anonymity has always fascinated me when it comes to the online environment, and i intend on keeping that shroud around me as much as i can.

### projects

currently, the list of projects i have developed and/or am developing is below. if you have a problem with them, let me know in their respective issues sections;

- Floodgates, an email flooder
    - currently, Floodgates only supports sending from Gmail and Outlook addresses. other providers are in the works.
- CMDAssistant, a Python-based command line assistant
    - it will come with a batch file that allows for easy installation and setup, even for those without Python.

### final remarks

as i am still embarking on the journey to improve and become a professional programmer, my projects may be simple, and easy to write with little advanced programming techniques being used. this will change, however, come the future, and more projects that do more will come to surface.
